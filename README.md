## üèì Velvet Pong

An exciting and nostalgic pong game with a modern, velvet-themed twist. This web-based game offers smooth gameplay, adjustable difficulty settings, and a cool, retro aesthetic. Compete against the AI or challenge a friend to a fast-paced game of pong, with dynamic sound effects and smooth animations.

## Project Overview

**Velvet Pong** is a simple yet engaging pong game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The game features two paddles (player and AI), a bouncing ball, a dynamic scoreboard, and interactive sound effects. Players can adjust the difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard) to make the game more challenging.

## Key Features

* **Two-player mode** with AI opponent.
* **Adjustable difficulty**: easy, medium, and hard.
* **Dynamic Sound Effects** for ball hits, wall bounces, and scores.
* **Responsive Design** optimized for various screen sizes.
* **Countdown timer** before the game starts.
* **Game Controls**: Start, Pause, and Reset buttons.
* **Modern Retro UI** with velvet colors, smooth animations, and a glowing aesthetic.

## How It Works

1. The game features two paddles: one controlled by the player and the other by the AI.
2. The player can move their paddle up or down using the mouse.
3. The ball moves according to a random direction and bounces off walls and paddles.
4. When the ball passes a paddle, the opponent scores a point, and the ball is reset to the center.
5. The game runs until one player reaches 10 points. The winner is displayed with a glowing text message.
6. The player can control the game with buttons for start, pause, and reset.
7. A countdown timer starts before each new game to add suspense and excitement.
